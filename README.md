Hello, historian! 

Welcome to the wonderful world of Pivot Point. We're so excited to have you here and for you to immerse yourself in the myriad of stories, characters, and time periods we've created.

For today's demo, we will be focusing in on the Great Depression. The Great Depression was the worst economic crisis in modern history, characterized by the stock market crash. Lasting from 1929-1939, unemployment rose exponentially to 25% and 1/3 of all commerical banks in the US failed. Our character is a banker who is attempting to navigate the start of this harrowing time in an effort to keep his family alive.
