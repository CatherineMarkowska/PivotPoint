          You work through the weekend, your pockets growing heavy with overtime pay as
          desperate customers empty their accounts and you reassure those who remain.
          Monday, October 28th arrives -Black Monday- and the market crashes again, harder
          this time. When you finally try to withdraw your own savings on Tuesday, the bank
          manager quietly informs you that withdrawals are now limited to $50 per week. Your
          $1200 is trapped.
